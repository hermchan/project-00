**Technical Requirements**

Meets expectations.

You used jQuery to listen for events, select DOM elements, and change the appearance of the page. 

Hard-coding the initial position at 135 causes the runners to jump back to the far left of the screen if the whole view is zoomed out.

Good commit messages. When cleaning this up for portfolio, create a new project and structure so that teaching team members don't show up as contributors on your project.


**Creativity**

Meets expectations.  Nice theme and graphics. Great idea to give the players instructions.  Thinking about user experience is important.

**Code Quality**  

Exceeds expectations.

Every code file is well done. Variable names make it easier to tell what your code is doing. You've used OOP very well. Spacing and indentation are consistent. File organization follows conventions. I'd like to see a comment or two in your js file explaining how your positioning works and/or which keys the player is supposed to press (since only keycodes are in the js). 

Remove unused code and sanity check console logs when you're cleaning projects up for your portfolio. 

**Overall**

Your built a working racing game with really, really solid code. Minor awkwardness with screen size as explained above (not 100% responsive), but that's understandable for this point in the course. Great job!
